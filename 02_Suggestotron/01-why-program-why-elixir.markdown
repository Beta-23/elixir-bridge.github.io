## Why Program?
  Programming is fun. It's also frustrating and difficult and creative and gives you a new perspective on the world. It's also a good job. You sit down (or stand at a standing desk), do your work, and go home. The worst hazards are RSI and spontaneous chair failure. It's in high demand, so it pays well. Until the machines can program themselves, there will be a need for people to make them do what humans need them to do. Also, everything is a computer now. Cars, phones, watches, even appliances like refrigerators and washing machines. Learning to program will help you understand all of these other machines. It gives you a perspective, a way to see things that are unknowable otherwise. That makes it powerful, even if your job isn't to write code every day.

## Why Elixir?
  Right at the start, Elixir is fast. It runs as well as or better than any other language at its level of abstraction, that is how far away from machine code. It's designed to work with modern computers that have many CPU cores that run in parallel, and even across networks. It has a pretty easy to understand syntax, relative to some languages. The official docs are thorough, with examples of how to use the functions and modules that are included in the language. It's relatively young, and the community is very welcoming to new people.
