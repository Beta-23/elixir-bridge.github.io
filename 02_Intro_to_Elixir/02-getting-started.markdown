### Goals

Create a new phoenix app


### Step 1

`cd` stands for change directory.

A directory is the same thing as a folder.

**Option 1 - On Windows**

Type the following into the terminal:

```
cd c:\Sites
```

**Option 1.2: Mac or Linux**

```
cd ~
```

### Step 2


Type the following into the terminal (if you've already created this in the Installfest, skip to step 3):

```
mkdir elixirbridge
```

### Step 3

Type the following into the terminal:

```
cd elixirbridge
```

Check to see if you have an app from a previous elixirbridge

**OSX/Linux**

Type the following into the terminal:

```
ls
```

ls stands for list


It lists the contents of the current directory. If you have any old getting_started apps in that list you can remove them
to prevent confusion.

Type the following into the terminal:

```
rm -rf getting_started
```


**Windows**

Type the following into the terminal:

```
dir
```

dir stands for directory.   


It lists the contents of the current directory.

If you have any old getting_started apps in that list you can remove them
to prevent confusion.

Type this in the terminal:

```
rmdir /s /q getting_started
```
