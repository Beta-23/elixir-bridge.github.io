## Pipe operator

One operator that we'll see often is the pipe operator `|>`. The `|>` pipe operator looks scary but really just passes the result of one function on to the next function. Conceptually, it's like running the function:

```
f(d(b(:atom)))
```

The equivalent version using pipes is

```
b(:atom) |> d() |> f()
```

The `pipe` operator helps our code stay clean and readable. We'll use it for cases where we want to transform a request type, or build up a data structure with different functions.


```elixir
42 |> is_number
[1, 2, 3] |> Enum.map(fn(x) -> x * x end)
[1, 2, 3] |> Enum.map(fn(x) -> x * x end) |> Enum.reduce(&+/2)
```
