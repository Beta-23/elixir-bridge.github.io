### GenServer
One of the benefits of using Elixir is its asynchronous nature by default. We can demonstrate this by making calls to an external api.

We are going to create a module in the lib directory of our application called `api_handler.ex`. It will be a handler for external api calls.

We are going to spin off a process that will ask to make calls to an external api, which will allow us to handle api calls in a non-blocking way - so tha tour application is free to continue answering http requests.  This feature allows elixir to be fast and non-blocking.

Because this pattern is so common in Erlang, the OTP library provides an interface called `GenServer`.
In Elixir we will create a module that implements this behavior.


In our lib directory lets create a file called  `api_handler.ex`. Inside this file let's define a module named `Myapp.ApiHandler`.

```elixir
defmodule Myapp.ApiServer do
  use GenServer
end
```

The GenServer behavior requires us to define functions for handling callbacks. The callbacks that we will be implementing are

* init/1
* handle_call/3
* handle_cast/2
* handle_info/2
* terminate/2

The `init/1` is called when the server starts up and `terminate/2` is called before the server shuts down.

```elixir
defmodule Myapp.ApiServer do
  use GenServer
  def init(args) do
    {:ok, args}
  end

  def terminate(reason, state) do
    :ok
  end
end
```

A GenServer is a process that listens for messages. We can send 3 different types of messages to our GenServer process.

The most basic message is using native Erlang message passing. When the GenServer receives a message in this way the `handle_info/2` callback is called.

```elixir
defmodule Myapp.ApiHandler do
  use GenServer

  def handle_info(term, state) do
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
```

We can send a message to the GenServer and wait for a response. In this case the `handle_call/3` function will receive the message.

```elixir
defmodule Myapp.ApiServer do
  use GenServer

  def handle_call(request, from, state) do
    {:reply, response, state}
  end
end
```

Finally, we can send a message and not wait for a response. GenServer will call the `handle_cast/2` callback to handle these messages.

```elixir
defmodule Myapp.ApiServer do
  use GenServer

  def handle_cast(request, state) do
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
```

Notice in each of these functions we have this variable called state. We can keep state of the module using this variable. We are not going to keep track of any state in our module, however know that this functionality is available.

So let's implement our module. We will focus on calls.

To call our GenServer we will use the `GenServer.call/2` function.

Let's add a function called `get_pokemon/1` to call our GenServer to retreive a pokemon.


```elixir
defmodule Myapp.ApiServer do
  use GenServer

  def get_pokemon(id_or_name) do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:get_poke, id_or_name})
  end
end
```

Notice that when we call the GenServer we are sending a tuple. We can use pattern matching in our `handle_call/3` callback to handle this message.


```elixir
defmodule Myapp.ApiServer do
  use GenServer

  def handle_call({:get_poke, id_or_name}, _pid, state) do
    {:ok, response} = get_poke_request(id_or_name)
    {:reply, response, state}
  end

  def handle_call(_term, _pid, state) do
    {:reply, [], state}
  end
end
```

So now we have completed our GenServer callback implementation. Let's complete the functionality by implementing the `get_poke_request/1` method.

But first let's add the required dependencies to our `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:cowboy, "~> 1.1"},
    {:plug, "~> 1.3.5"},
    {:httpoison, "~> 0.12.0"},
    {:poison, "~> 3.1"},
    {:earmark, "~> 1.2", only: :dev},
    {:ex_doc, "~> 0.15.1", only: :dev},
  ]
end
```

HTTPoison is an http client for elixir. Poison is a json library for elixir

Let's fetch our dependencies by calling `mix deps.get`. Now let's implement our `get_poke_request/1` method.

```elixir
defmodule Myapp.ApiHandler do
  use GenServer

  def get_poke_request(id_or_name) do
    url = api_route("pokemon/#{id_or_name}/")
    case HTTPoison.get(url, [], []) do
      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{reason: reason}} ->
        {:error, reason}
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body}} ->
        {:ok, body }
    end
  end

  defp api_route(path) do
    "http://pokeapi.co/api/v2/#{path}"
  end
end
```

We'll start the GenServer process with out supervisor we implemented previously.

The `GenServer.start_link/3` function starts a process linked to the current process. Often times this is used in a Supervision tree.

Let's add our `ApiHandler` module to our supervision tree. Open up our `myapp.ex` file. We will add our ApiServer as a child in our supervision tree.

Add the following line to our list of children:

Our list of chidren should now look like this now:

```elixir
def start(_type, _args) do
    Supervisor.start_link([{NewApp.Router, []}, {NewApp.ApiHandler, []}, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
```

When our app is started it will start our ApiHandler as a child process.

Now we can call our `get_poke_request/1` function from our router.

```elixir
defmodule Myapp.Router do
  use Plug.
  
  get("/:name") do
    query_params = Plug.Conn.fetch_query_params(conn)
    name =  query_params.params["name"] || 1
    pokemon = NewApp.ApiServer.get_pokemon(name)
    conn
      |> put_resp_content_type("application/json")
      |> send_resp(200, pokemon)
  end  
end
```

Now we have a non-blocking GenServer that calls an external api in an efficient way.

The last thing we want to call out is that we want to register our GenServer with the Erlang name server.

We will do this with the `start_link/2` function by calling `GenServer.start_link/3` with the name we want to register the GenServer under. Below we are registering the GenServer with the name of the module.

```elixir
defmodule Myapp.ApiHandler do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(default) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [], name: __MODULE__)
  end
end
```

The complete `ApiHandler` module looks like this:

```elixir
defmodule NewApp.ApiHandler do 
  use GenServer

  def init(args) do
    {:ok, args}  
  end

  def start_link(_) do 
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, [], name: __MODULE__)    
  end  

   @doc """
  A method for calling the pokemon api
  """
  def get_pokemon(id_or_name) do
    GenServer.call(__MODULE__, {:get_poke, id_or_name})
  end

  def terminate(reason, state) do
    :ok
  end

  def handle_call({:get_poke, id_or_name}, _pid, state) do
    {:ok, response} = get_poke_request(id_or_name)
    {:reply, response, state}  
  end

  def handle_call(_term, _pid, state) do
    {:reply, [], state}
  end

  def handle_cast(request, state) do
    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_info(term, state) do 
    {:noreply, state}
  end  

  def terminate do
    :ok
  end


  def get_poke_request(id_or_name) do
    url = api_route("pokemon/#{id_or_name}/")
    case HTTPoison.get(url, [], []) do
      {:error, %HTTPoison.Error{reason: reason}} ->
        {:error, reason}
      {:ok, %HTTPoison.Response{body: body}} ->
        {:ok, body }
    end
  end

  defp api_route(path) do
    "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/#{path}"
  end
end

```
